# Dublin Digital Radio Mixcloud Toolkit

A Google Chrome extension for making Mixcloud easier to use for ddr residents

## Getting started

1. On chrome://extensions, enable developer mode on the top right corner.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Build the extension by running `npm run build`.
4. On chrome://extensions, load the built extension by clicking on "Load unpacked" and find the `build` directory in this project.
5. After making changes, repeat from step (3).

## Features

### Better playlist selector

On an uploaded show page, such as `https://www.mixcloud.com/DublinDigitalRadio/<uploaded-show-name>`, this extension replaces the add to play list button with a music note icon with an "add to playlist" button. This new button opens a pop up with a list of all playlist with a search bar.

Adding a show to the playlist will put the show at the top of the list.
